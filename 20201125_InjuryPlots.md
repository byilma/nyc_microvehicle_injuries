Pull and Tidy
================
11/6/2020

``` r
#cleaning - transpose so vehicle types are listed in one column
crash_dat_tidy = 
  crash_dat %>% 
  mutate(
    date = lubridate::date(crash_date)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    dow = as.factor(weekdays(crash_date))
  ) %>%
  separate(crash_date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         month = as.integer(month),
         day = as.integer(day)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    vehicle_type_code1:vehicle_type_code_5,
    names_to = "vehicle_number",
    values_to = "vehicle_options"
   ) %>%
  drop_na(vehicle_options) %>%
  select(date, everything())
```

**My goal was to compare the rate of injuries in a crash in 2020 to the
same month in 2019 (e.g., rate of injuries in January 2020 v. rate of
injuries in January 2019). I examined January through October. I
additionally stratified these rate ratio estimates by borough.**

**To accomplish this, I filtered the tidy data to create one dataset for
microvehicles and one for bikes. In each dataset, I then created nested
datasets by month, and, in each of these datasets, I mapped Poisson
models to extract rate ratio estimates for number of injuries in each
borough. Finally, I unnessted these models to extract the desired
coefficients: rate ratios and standard errors (used to compute 95%
confidence intervals).**

**Below, I write functions to easily filter for either microvehicles or
for bikes.**

``` r
filter_for = function(dataset, type) {
  if (type == "micro") {
  dataset %>% filter(str_detect(vehicle_options, "[Bb]ike") | 
           str_detect(vehicle_options, "REVEL") | 
           str_detect(vehicle_options, "SCO")  |
           str_detect(vehicle_options, "MOP")   |
           str_detect(vehicle_options, "ELEC")  |
           str_detect(vehicle_options, "^E-")) %>% 
  filter(vehicle_options != "ESCOVATOR" & vehicle_options != "Bike" &
      str_detect(vehicle_options, "Dirt", negate = TRUE),
      str_detect(vehicle_options, "[Mm]otorbike", negate = TRUE)
           )
}

  else if (type == "bike") {
  dataset %>% filter(str_starts(vehicle_options, "[Bb]ike")) 
  }
}
```

**First, I tested to see if there was an overall association of 2020 v.
2019 with number of injuries in microvehicle crashes.**

``` r
month_df=
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = factor(month.name, ordered = TRUE, levels = month.name)
  )
```

``` r

         models = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-data) %>% 
  unnest(models) %>%

**Although there was no statistically significant evidence for a
different rate of injury in 2020 v. 21 in any month, I proceeded to
examine this stratified by borough.**

**Below, I extract the rate ratio estimates for the microvehicle data by
borough.**

    ## # A tibble: 0 x 5
    ## # â€¦ with 5 variables: month <ord>, term <chr>, estimate <dbl>, std.error <dbl>,
    ## #   p.value <dbl>

**Here, I extract my coefficient of interest, which is the difference in
injury rate in microvehicle crashes occurring in 2020 v. occurring in
2019. I plot estimates for each borough within each month, making sure
to exponentiate these estimates. I include a horizontal line at Y = 1 to
indicate the null value.**
