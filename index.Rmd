## Background


New York City is notorious for being a "car-congested" place to live in. The trains can feel just as congested, too. 
People often opt for alternative ways of commuting, when possible. Recently, the number of options for 'alternative' means of commuting have increased! 
Bikes, mopeds. e-bikes. e-scooters are all fair game. 

This is great! But, with more bikes, scooters, mopeds and the like out in the streets, we wanted to know more about how, if at all, the number of incidents involving these alternative means commuting has changed. 

We were also particularly interested to see how the shelter-in-place due to covid-19 impacted the rate of incidents. How do the number of incidents post-covide compare to pre-covid times? 





## Datasets


With this in mind, we took to the New York City Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes data to look into this further.

* [Crash Data Source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)


Here's a sneak peak of what our data looks like:

```{r}
crash_dat = read.csv("./data/crash_dat.csv")

crash_dat %>% select(date, crash_time, borough,number_of_persons_injured, contributing_factor_vehicle_1) %>% head(6) %>% knitr::kable()
```



As well as data on `bike count` data, which gave us the daily total of bikes that were involved in crashes


* [Bike-count Data Source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj)





We also incorporate weather data from NOAA

## Focus of our Project

Our project focuses on the use of particular types of alternate means of transportations, namely: bicycles and microvehicles. 

We all know what bikes are, but what exactly are `Microvehicles`: 

The ITF report, defined Microvehicles as: â€œ: vehicles with a mass of no more than 350 kg (771 lb) and a design speed no higher than 45 km/h. Here's [ITF's report](https://data.cityofnewyork.us) if you're interested. 

Here are some gifs (pronounced 'jif', of course) to show you what we mean:

#### E-scooters (like "lime")

## Main Questions

We wanted to ask some of the big questions on incidents involving Bikes and Microvehicles: 

- *Where in  NYC* do we see the most incidents involving Bikes and Microvehicles?

- What does the *trend* of incidents involving Bikes and Microvehicles look like? 

- What are some *factors* that contribute to these incidents?

- In particular we also wanted to see how the these incidents may have changed in the context of COVID-19 and the shelter in place?

- Do we see any *statistically significant* differences in incident rates comparing pre-covid to post covid? 

- Lastly, we wanted to see if we could build a predictive model using weather data, considering factors such as maximum/minimum temperature and daily precipitation? 


## Take aways

-- Bike and Micro-Vehicles incidents tend display seasonality, just like the weather. 
-- The Top contributing factor to these incidents is: Driver Inattention. 
-- The Possion regression analysis we computed showed that were no signifcant differences in the rate of incidents involving bikes or Microvehicles. 
-- Downtown Manhattan saw the most crashes within the last 2 years.
