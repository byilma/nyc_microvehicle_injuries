## Background


New York City is notorious for being a "car-congested" place to live in. The trains can feel just as congested, too. 
People often opt for alternative ways of commuting, when possible. Recently, the number of options for 'alternative' means of commuting have increased! 
Bikes, mopeds. e-bikes. e-scooters are all fair game. 

This is great! But, with more bikes, scooters, mopeds and the like out in the streets, we wanted to know more about how, if at all, the number of incidents involving these alternative means commuting has changed. 

We were also particularly interested to see how the shelter-in-place due to covid-19 impacted the rate of incidents. How do the number of incidents post-covide compare to pre-covid times? 





## Datasets


With this in mind, we took to the New York City Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes data to look into this further.

* [Crash Data Source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)


Here's a sneak peak of what our data looks like:

```{r}
crash_dat = read.csv("./data/crash_dat.csv")

crash_dat %>% select(date, crash_time, borough,number_of_persons_injured, contributing_factor_vehicle_1) %>% head(6) %>% knitr::kable()
```

We also incorporate weather data from NOAA 

* [Weather Data Source](https://www.noaa.gov)


As well as data on `bike count` data, which gave us the daily total of bikes that were involved in crashes

## Focus of our Project

Our project focuses on the use of particular types of alternate means of transportations, namely: bicycles and microvehicles. 

We all know what bikes are, but what exactly are `Microvehicles`: 

The ITF report, defined Microvehicles as: â€œ: vehicles with a mass of no more than 350 kg (771 lb) and a design speed no higher than 45 km/h. Here's [ITF's report](https://data.cityofnewyork.us) if you're interested. 

Here are some gifs (pronounced 'jif', of course) to show you what we mean
