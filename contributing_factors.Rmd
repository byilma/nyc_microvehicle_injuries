Exploring contributing factors for crashes that result in an injury to a cyclist. Subsetting to crashes in March - October and classifying 2019 as pre-COVID and 2020 as COVID.

```{r contributing_factor}
crash_factor = 
  bikes %>%
  filter(
    month %in% (3:10),
    number_of_cyclist_injured > 0
    ) %>%

    contributing_factor_vehicle_1:contributing_factor_vehicle_5,
    names_to = "vehicle_factor_num",
    names_prefix = "contributing_factor_vehicle_",
    values_to = "contributing_factor"
   ) %>%
  mutate(
    covid = as.factor(if_else(year == 2019, 'Pre-COVID', 'COVID'))
  ) %>%
  group_by(covid, contributing_factor) %>%
  summarise(
    collisions = n_distinct(collision_id)
  ) %>%
  drop_na(contributing_factor) %>%
  ungroup(contributing_factor) %>%
  filter(contributing_factor != "Unspecified") %>%
  mutate(
    covid = fct_relevel(covid, 'Pre-COVID'),
    proportion = round(collisions / sum(collisions), 2) 
  )

  crash_factor %>%
  group_by(covid) %>%
  top_n(n = 10, wt = proportion) %>%

    contributing_factor = fct_reorder(as.factor(contributing_factor), collisions, .desc = TRUE)
  ) %>%

  )

```

The leading contributing causes for cyclist injuries did not change during COVID, with the majority of crashes involving driver error, such as driver inattention and failure to yield. There is a slight decrease in the proportion of crashes involving cyclist error.

  mutate(
    covid = as.factor(if_else(year == 2019, 'Pre-COVID', 'COVID'))
  ) %>%
  group_by(covid, hour, dow) %>%
  summarise(
    collisions = n_distinct(collision_id)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    covid = fct_relevel(covid, 'Pre-COVID'),
    dow = fct_relevel(dow, "Sunday", "Saturday", "Friday", "Thursday", "Wednesday", "Tuesday")
